We provide related codes of NMAAP for OFDP.

## Introduction
An efficient food delivery strategy is of importance for the O2O platforms, as it directly determines the customer satisfaction and in turn the competitiveness of the platform. The O2O food delivery problem (OFDP) can be viewed as a combination of variants of VRP, such as CVRP, VRPPD, VRPTW. VRP has been proven to be an NP-Complete problem. Hence, it is almost impractical to design exact algorithms for large-scale VRPs. We first defined and modeled the OFDP mathematically. Then, we proposed a niche-based memetic algorithm with adaptive parameters (NMAAP), a heuristic algorithm, to solve the problem.
